Title: CollidingAssociations_RotatingView_m84.mp4
Caption: Rotating view of the colliding stellar associations UPK 535 (blue squares) and Yep 3 (red diamonds) at the peak of their collision 0.84 Myr ago. Positions in RA, Dec, and distance d have been projected into xyz space as y, z, and x, respectively, and then extrapolated backwards in time according to proper motions and radial velocities. Errors in distances ~7.6 pc contribute to a likely artificial elongation in the radial (x) direction. Ellipsoids were fitted to contain 75 per cent of each association's stars in the present day and then shifted according to each association's motions through time. The ellipsoid volume overlap region is marked with magenta.
