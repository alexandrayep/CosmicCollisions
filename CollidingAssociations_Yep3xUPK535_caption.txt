Title: CollidingAssociations_Yep3xUPK535.mp4
Caption: Association collision in the Yep 3 (diamonds) centre-of-mass rest frame. Positions in RA, Dec, and distance d of the colliding stellar associations UPK 535 (squares) and Yep 3 have been projected into xyz space as y, z, and x, respectively, and then extrapolated linearly through time according to proper motions and radial velocities. Errors in distances ~7.6 pc contribute to a likely artificial elongation in the radial (x) direction. Gravitational potentials of the associations and the Galaxy are neglected. The apparent expansion of the associations into the past or future results from a combination of proper motion uncertainties ~0.24 mas/yr and linear extrapolation and is not representative of the stars' relative motion. The simulation is most robust within a few million years of the present. The animation pauses at today's epoch (0.0 Myr).
